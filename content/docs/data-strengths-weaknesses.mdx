title: Data Types Pros and Cons
description: Pros and Cons of different data types
---


## Program-Generated Data

Program data is efficient and great for tracking over time, but I’ve run into issues like missing fields or inconsistent formats. It’s a solid starting point, but I always plan to fill in the gaps with extra data collection.


<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Can provide systematic information on services delivered, staff supports, or clients served, eliminating the need for original data collection.  
    • Often longitudinal, allowing for understanding of a program’s operation and implementation over time.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Because the data are used to monitor services and not necessarily for evaluation purposes, there may be limited information on data of interest to an evaluator, and data quality (e.g., missing data, inconsistent coding or measurement) might be an issue.  
    • Data may not cover the entire time span (e.g., pre-program experiences) or population of interest to a study.  
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Administrative Records Data

Administrative records are a goldmine—standardized, long-term data that saves time and works well with other sources. But access delays, linking difficulties, and missing context can limit their usefulness for deeper analysis.

<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>

  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Data are comprehensive, cover long periods of time, and are standardized across places or settings, eliminating the need for original data collection and allowing for analysis of longer-term outcomes.  
    • Can be combined with other data sources to create a richer understanding.  
    • May contain relevant data for both program and comparison groups.  
  </TabsContent>

  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Often long lag times between when data are collected and when records are available to researchers. If administrative records must be linked to other data sources, the data acquisition process will be further lengthened and may be complicated.  
    • May be missing important information about the specific population of interest to the evaluator.  
    • May not contain high-quality data on specific services a program provided or more nuanced aspects of service delivery.  
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Secondary Data  

Secondary data is convenient and cost-effective, offering broad comparisons across contexts—but it rarely fits your exact needs. Timing, relevance, and detail can be off, and it often lacks the specificity or scale needed for focused projects.
<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • May contain information on elements not available in program-generated or administrative data (e.g., background sociodemographic information for the target population).  
    • Useful for comparative purposes, because the same survey instrument and measures are used across contexts (e.g., the Demographic and Health Survey contains data on the same indicators for over 90 low- and middle-income countries).  
    • Data can be easily accessed, often through online databases.  
    • Cost-effective.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • May not cover the precise period of interest or with the frequency needed (e.g., a study might want to assess annual changes, but secondary surveys may be conducted less frequently), and there may be lags in data availability.  
    • May not include specific information or desired measures and are unlikely to include data about specific beneficiaries or a particular program of interest.  
    • Data are collected infrequently at times and based on self-reports, so items may have recall and self-report bias.  
    • Some data are presented at the regional or national level and cannot be disaggregated by small geographic entities (e.g., a village).  
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Survey Data  

Survey data is great because you control exactly what you ask, target the right population, and can compare results across studies. But it’s time-consuming, costly, and full of logistical hurdles—from design to data quality issues.
<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Give researchers control over what information is collected (including level of detail) to ensure that data directly map onto the research questions.  
    • When using an existing validated or standardized measure, can compare results to those of other studies and populations.  
    • Collect consistent and systematic data from a specific population of direct interest (e.g., service providers, program participants).  
    • Can identify and survey specific individuals from the program and comparison groups, rather than creating nonrandom comparison groups from secondary or administrative data sources (which may be prone to bias).  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Costly to conduct because surveys involve meticulous instrument design, formatting and programming, pilot testing, and translation.  
    • Survey administration is time- and resource-intensive and can be complicated to implement, often requiring respondent incentives, location and tracking efforts, close monitoring of response rates, and course correction if there is low completion or sample attrition. In some contexts, language or cultural barriers and weather risks further complicate fielding surveys.  
    • Self-administered surveys risk misinterpretation or missing data.  
    • Paper-based surveys risk errors in data entry.  
  </TabsContent>

##  Assessment 

Assessments offer precise, standardized data that's often more accurate than self-reports and easy to compare across studies. But they can be expensive, require trained staff, and place a high burden on participants—making timing and consistency real challenges.

<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Capture constructs with rigor and precision difficult to capture via self-report or proxies (e.g., biomarker data based on urine samples to measure nicotine in a body's system, compared to self-reported behaviors of cigarette smoking, which are subject to imprecision and bias).  
    • Can gather the same information from a large sample.  
    • May be quicker to analyze than qualitative assessments, particularly if data are entered electronically while the assessment is administered.  
    • Use of validated assessment tools (e.g., the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement) allows for comparing results to other studies.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Sizable costs, including payments for use of proprietary tools, payments to laboratories to analyze biospecimen data, purchase or creation of assessment materials, hiring and training of specialized data collectors, and close monitoring of collection procedures.  
    • Risk of low compliance to study protocols by data collectors, which results in low-quality data (e.g., an assessor does not code responses consistently).  
    • Greater burden on participants (e.g., can be more time-intensive or invasive) may lead to lower response rates.  
    • Timing for administering assessments can be crucial (e.g., children receiving a new program should be assessed at the same time to minimize differences due to differential exposure to the program).  
  </TabsContent>

##  In-Depth Interview Methods 


In-depth interviews offer rich, nuanced insights you can’t get from surveys, with the flexibility to explore unexpected topics. But they’re time-consuming, rely heavily on interviewer skill, and balancing structure with spontaneity can be tricky.

<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Gather a large amount of detailed information from respondents.  
    • Allow for flexibility while collecting data (e.g., probing on a particular issue or topic in fuller depth when needed) and allow new topics to be brought up by respondents and included in analysis—topics that would not emerge if using a closed-ended survey.  
    • Interviewers can probe on meaning and inconsistencies that arise in an interview, which provides nuance to understanding a respondent's reasoning and behavior.  
    • Can probe on more sensitive topics a respondent may not answer truthfully in front of others, such as in a focus group setting.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Time-intensive, requiring significant effort for each interview and for analyzing the resulting data.  
    • Quality of data obtained is highly influenced by an interviewer's training and skills.  
    • Because unstructured interviews allow researchers to follow promising conversational threads, a thematic analysis across respondents may be more difficult than with semi-structured interviews.  
    • Semi-structured interviews may be less responsive to the interviewer-interviewee dynamic than unstructured formats, which could affect the richness of the data.  
    • New questions may emerge after data collection, but follow-up with respondents for clarification may not be feasible.  
  </TabsContent>

## Focus Group

Focus groups are a cost-effective way to gather diverse perspectives and spark dynamic discussions, especially for exploring group consensus or disagreement. But they offer less depth than interviews, depend heavily on a skilled moderator, and can be skewed by group dynamics or scheduling challenges.

<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Cost-effective and efficient.  
    • Provide a breadth of perspectives and opinions.  
    • Respondents can "play off each other" in useful and illustrative ways, which takes advantage of the group-based dynamic in understanding an issue.  
    • Group-based dynamic also allows researchers to understand whether there is group consensus on a specific topic and explore when and why there might be a lack of a consensus.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Compared to in-depth interviews, fewer questions will be covered and there will likely be less depth of perspectives.  
    • Challenging to organize (e.g., require scheduling that works for multiple people).  
    • Rely heavily on the quality of the moderator to ensure that all viewpoints are incorporated and keep the focus group "on track" without influencing responses or discouraging participation.  
    • Individual respondents may mask true opinions for fear of stigma or judgment.  
    • Respondents may be swayed by what others say, agreeing with others' opinions even if they would not otherwise offer this view.  
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

##  Ethnographic Research Methods 

Ethnographic research offers deep, immersive insight by capturing real-life experiences in context—but it’s time-intensive, costly, and demands careful attention to bias, influence, and overwhelming amounts of data. The payoff? Unmatched depth and understanding.

<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Gather very rich information about a setting and participants over a period of time, across many different topics and in natural environments.  
    • Provide thick description (more so than in-depth interviews) about a program from participants' viewpoints, as the researcher is actually partaking in the program while collecting data.  
    • Allow for an understanding of how social interactions and relationships affect an individual's decisions and behaviors.  
    • Can shift focus or research questions to be responsive to unexpected ideas or events that emerge on the ground.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Can be extremely time-intensive and costly, requiring multiple visits to a program, relationship building, and a deep level of engagement. Also require a high level of effort to document observations and conversations.  
    • Researchers need to be constantly aware of how their role as an observer affects how people are behaving and self-reflective about how their own lens and potential biases may affect what they choose to document.  
    • Given the vast amount of detailed data generated, analyzing themes and patterns across settings, observations, or researchers can be challenging.  
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

##  Direct Observation Methods 

Direct observation lets you capture real-time behaviors and interactions—what’s actually happening, not just what’s reported. It’s flexible and rich, but time-consuming, requires careful protocols, and can be influenced by your presence. Still, it offers insights no other method can.

<Tabs defaultValue="Pros">
  <TabsList>
    <TabsTrigger value="Pros">Pros</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="Cons">Cons</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="Pros">
    • Researchers can record all activities they see and document the perceived quality of those activities, giving a detailed description of settings and interactions.  
    • Observers gather data using prespecified fields but also have flexibility to record unexpected activities and to provide a finer description of events that emerge as more salient.  
    • Can be used in flexible ways. Data may be quantified (e.g., three out of five classrooms had take-home flyers for parents), but can also include narrative descriptions of settings or observed interactions.  
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="Cons">
    • Can be time-intensive, such that researchers must spend several hours at one program observing particular activities and then recording detailed notes. The less structured the protocol, the more time-intensive the data collection.  
    • If direct observations are a primary form of data collection (e.g., observations of service provision are the primary data source for assessing implementation fidelity), one may need to follow a more complicated protocol, which requires more resources and training.  
    • Researchers need to be aware of their presence in the setting and how it may influence the events they observe.  
  </TabsContent>
