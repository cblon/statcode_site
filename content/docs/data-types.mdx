## Quantitative and Qualitative Data

I find the breakdown between quantitative and qualitative data really helpful—it’s something I think about often when planning evaluations. Quantitative data is great when I need solid numbers to answer questions like “how much” or “to what extent,” especially when I’m reporting to stakeholders who want clear, measurable results. But I also rely on qualitative data to get the deeper story—what’s really happening behind the numbers. Those open-ended responses and interviews often reveal things I wouldn’t catch otherwise. Using both together gives me a more complete picture of what’s working and what needs adjustment.

| **Purpose**       | - To answer questions of “What?”, “How much?”, “How often?”, “To what extent?”, or “For whom?”  <br /> - To provide information that can be analyzed and represented statistically, with validity and reliability | - To answer questions of “How?” or “Why?”  <br /> - To provide rich and nuanced details on programs, processes, and perspectives <br /> - To solicit different perspectives and opinions <br /> - To contextualize and complement quantitative findings |
| **Approach**      | - More objective, closed-ended  <br /> - Large numbers of participants  <br /> - Structured                                                                  | - More subjective, open-ended  <br /> - Not dependent on sample size; sample sizes tend to be small  <br /> - Semi-structured or unstructured                    |
| **Analysis**      | - Statistical methods—for example:  <br /> • Descriptive analysis (means, medians, distributions)  <br /> • Correlation analysis  <br /> • Regression analysis     | - Nonstatistical methods—for example:  <br /> • Coding  <br /> • Recursive abstraction  <br />  • Content analysis    |
| **Resulting Data**| - Quantified averages and measures of variation  <br /> - Values that can be represented statistically  <br /> - May be generalizable if study sample is similar to a larger population | - Open-ended text summarizing main themes  <br /> - Description of contexts, processes, variations, and relationships  <br /> - Not generalizable—specific to study setting and participants |
