## `dbt run`

The workhorse command that **executes your models** and creates views/tables in your data warehouse.

### Basic Usage

```bash
dbt run
````

**Output:**

```
12:00:00 | Concurrency: 4 threads (target='dev')
12:00:00 | 
12:00:00 | 1 of 5 START model my_project.stg_orders.... [RUN]
12:00:01 | 1 of 5 OK created model my_project.stg_orders [SUCCESS 1 in 1.00s]
...
12:00:05 | Completed successfully
```

---

## `dbt run --select`

Run only specific models.

### Example 1: Single model

```bash
dbt run --select my_first_dbt_model
```

### Example 2: A staging model

```bash
dbt run --select stg_reviews
```

### Example 3: A model by fully qualified name (FQN)

```bash
dbt run --select analytics.dim_venues
```

### Example 4: A source path or group

```bash
dbt run --select src.src_reviews
```

**Output:**

```
12:02:00 | START model analytics.dim_venues [RUN]
12:02:01 | OK created model analytics.dim_venues [SUCCESS 1 in 1.01s]
```

---

##  `dbt run --full-refresh`

For **incremental models**, this **drops and rebuilds** them entirely.

```bash
dbt run --full-refresh
```

**With filters:**

```bash
dbt run --select dim_venues --full-refresh
```

**Output:**

```
12:03:00 | Full refresh requested for: 1 incremental model
12:03:01 | Dropping table analytics.dim_venues...
12:03:02 | Creating table analytics.dim_venues...
```

---

##  `dbt test`

Runs **schema and data tests** on your models.

```bash
dbt test
```

### Select a specific model:

```bash
dbt test --select dim_venues
```

**Output:**

```
12:04:00 | START test not_null_dim_venues_venue_id.... [RUN]
12:04:00 | PASS not_null_dim_venues_venue_id [PASS in 0.5s]
12:04:00 | PASS unique_dim_venues_venue_id [PASS in 0.3s]
```

---

##  `dbt test --select` (Examples)

```bash
dbt test --select test
```

or

```bash
dbt test --select dim.dim_listings_cleansed
```

You can also run tests for a folder or group of models:

```bash
dbt test --select dim.*
```

---

##  `dbt seed`

Loads CSV files from the `data/` folder into your warehouse.

```bash
dbt seed
```

**Output:**

```
12:05:00 | START seed file seed_states.csv [RUN]
12:05:01 | OK loaded seed file seed_states.csv [INSERT 50 rows in 0.8s]
```

---

##  `dbt source freshness`

Check **freshness** of your raw source data.

```bash
dbt source freshness
```

**Output:**

```
12:06:00 | freshness of source "src_reviews" is 2 hours (warn after: 12, error after: 24)
12:06:00 | PASS freshness checks
```

Set thresholds in `sources.yml` using `freshness: warn_after:` and `error_after:`.

---

##  `dbt compile`

Compiles all models (applies Jinja) into SQL in the `target/` directory.

```bash
dbt compile
```

**Output:**

```
12:07:00 | Compiled 20 models
```

Great for debugging or previewing final SQL.

---

##  `dbt list` (Bonus!)

Lists models or nodes that match filters. Super useful for scripting or CI/CD.

```bash
dbt list --select tag:core
```

```bash
dbt list --select path:models/marts/finance/
```

---

##  More `--select` Examples

```bash
# Run all dim models
dbt run --select dim.*

# Run everything in marts folder
dbt run --select path:models/marts/

# Run all models downstream of a source
dbt run --select +src_reviews

# Run all models upstream of a fact table
dbt run --select fct.fct_reviews+

# Run only tests, not models
dbt test --exclude tag:deprecated
```

---


Hereâ€™s a quick reference table:

| Command                       | Purpose                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `dbt run`                     | Build all models             |
| `dbt run --select model_name` | Run a specific model         |
| `dbt test`                    | Run all data tests           |
| `dbt seed`                    | Load CSVs into warehouse     |
| `dbt compile`                 | Generate final SQL           |
| `dbt source freshness`        | Check source data freshness  |
| `dbt run --full-refresh`      | Rebuild incremental models   |
| `dbt list`                    | List nodes by tag, path, etc |

---

 Use `--select` and `--exclude` together for precise control.

```bash
dbt run --select tag:core --exclude dim_venues
```

This helps when debugging or targeting small sections of your DAG.
