title: Snowflake Sample Setup and Data Import
description: Differences Between Quantitative and Qualitative Data
---

This project is working with some Airbnb data stored in an open S3 bucket. To get started, we first connect to the right Snowflake environment by selecting our compute warehouse and setting the database and schema to `airbnb.RAW`.



## Snowflake Sample Setup

```sql
-- Use an admin role
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Create the `transform` role
CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS TRANSFORM;
GRANT ROLE TRANSFORM TO ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;

-- Create the default warehouse if necessary
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS COMPUTE_WH;
GRANT OPERATE ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE TRANSFORM;

-- Create the `dbt` user and assign to role
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS dbt
  PASSWORD='Password123'
  LOGIN_NAME='dbt'
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD=FALSE
  DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE='COMPUTE_WH'
  DEFAULT_ROLE=TRANSFORM
  DEFAULT_NAMESPACE='AIRBNB.RAW'
  COMMENT='DBT user used for data transformation';
ALTER USER dbt SET TYPE = LEGACY_SERVICE;
GRANT ROLE TRANSFORM to USER dbt;

-- Create our database and schemas
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS AIRBNB;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS AIRBNB.RAW;

-- Set up permissions to role `transform`
GRANT ALL ON WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH TO ROLE TRANSFORM; 
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE TRANSFORM;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE TRANSFORM;
GRANT ALL ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE AIRBNB to ROLE TRANSFORM;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA AIRBNB.RAW to ROLE TRANSFORM;
GRANT ALL ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA AIRBNB.RAW to ROLE TRANSFORM;
```



## Data Import


Once we're in the right place, we create three raw tables to hold the data: one for **listings**, one for **reviews**, and one for **hosts**. These are basic versions of the tables, just meant to bring the raw data in.

After setting up the tables, we load the data directly from public CSV files hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket called `dbtlearn`. Each table gets its own corresponding CSV file:

- `listings.csv` goes into `raw_listings`
- `reviews.csv` goes into `raw_reviews`
- `hosts.csv` goes into `raw_hosts`

The `COPY INTO` command handles the data load, making sure to skip the header row and treat quoted fields properly.

In short, we’re laying the groundwork by pulling in raw Airbnb data from the cloud and organizing it into a format we can clean and analyze later—kind of like stocking your pantry before you start cooking.


```sql
-- Set up the defaults
USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
USE DATABASE airbnb;
USE SCHEMA RAW;

-- Create our three tables and import the data from S3
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE raw_listings
                    (id integer,
                     listing_url string,

                     host_id integer,

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE raw_reviews

                     comments string,
                     sentiment string);

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE raw_hosts

                     created_at datetime,

COPY INTO raw_hosts (id, name, is_superhost, created_at, updated_at)
                   from 's3://dbtlearn/hosts.csv'
                    FILE_FORMAT = (type = 'CSV' skip_header = 1
                    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"');
